> 📊 **Note**: This changelog was generated by analyzing 8 commits across 2 detailed chunks for comprehensive, high-quality coverage.

### 🔧 Technical Changes
### Technical Changelog Summary
This set of commits is focused exclusively on documentation and repository telemetry: automated and manual updates to the README WakaTime graph and a weekly changelog refresh. No functional code changes, tests, bug fixes, or refactors were introduced.

#### Main Changes by Category

**Features:**
- No new application/runtime features were added.

**Bug Fixes:**
- No bug fixes were made.

**Refactoring:**
- No refactoring or code restructuring occurred.

**Infrastructure/DevOps:**
- GitHub Actions automation (github-actions[bot]) committed regenerated WakaTime README graph assets on:
  - 2026-01-20
  - 2026-01-21
  - 2026-01-22
  - 2026-01-24
  - 2026-01-25
  - 2026-01-26
- These commits indicate a periodic CI job that pulls the latest WakaTime metrics and pushes generated assets to the repository (committed static artifacts rather than dynamic badges or external service calls).
- Note: automated commit activity increases repository churn (generated-file commits). Ensure CI push tokens follow least-privilege and rotation best practices.

**Documentation:**
- README WakaTime graph was updated with new metrics on the dates listed above to keep the repository’s coding-activity visualization current.
  - Scope: README asset/visualization updates only; no application logic affected.
- Weekly changelog entry updated for week 04, 2026:

*Generated on 11-24-2025 - 8 commits*


> 📊 **Note**: This changelog was generated by analyzing 8 commits across 2 detailed chunks for comprehensive, high-quality coverage.

### 🔧 Technical Changes
### Technical Changelog Summary
This period’s activity was focused exclusively on documentation and developer-activity visualizations. The repository’s README WakaTime graph was regenerated and committed multiple times by CI, and weekly changelog/documentation entries were updated manually. No application logic, tests, or refactorings were introduced.

#### Main Changes by Category

**Features:**
- No new application features were added.

**Bug Fixes:**
- No bug fixes were included.

**Refactoring:**
- No code refactoring occurred.

**Infrastructure/DevOps:**
- GitHub Actions automation ran repeatedly to regenerate the WakaTime README graph and committed the generated assets back to the repository (commits by github-actions[bot] on 2025-11-18, 2025-11-19, 2025-11-21, 2025-11-22, 2025-11-23, and 2025-11-24).
- The CI workflow is configured to produce and commit README telemetry artifacts; this is a low-risk documentation update pattern but requires a CI identity with repository write permissions.

**Documentation:**
- README visualization updated: the WakaTime-based graph in the repository README was refreshed to include newly tracked metrics across the above CI runs.
- Weekly changelog/documentation updated: docs/changelog (week 47, 2025) and a manual weekly update were committed by Vitexus (2025-11-17) and Vítězslav Dvořák (2025-11-21), respectively, to capture recent activity and reference the refreshed metrics.

**Testing:**
- No tests were added or modified.

#### Technical Highlights
- Automation-first: Continued use of GitHub Actions to regenerate and commit WakaTime/metrics graphs keeps README visuals current without manual intervention.
- Scope and impact: All changes are documentation/artifact updates (images/markdown); there are no changes to application logic, dependencies, or runtime behavior.
- Security/permissions: The workflow requires a CI token with repository write access. Ensure tokens are scoped minimally and rotated periodically.
- Operational note: Frequent automated commits can clutter history. Consider batching updates, reducing run frequency, or using distinct commit messages/tags to improve history clarity.

### 📈 User Impact
### Summary of Recent Updates
