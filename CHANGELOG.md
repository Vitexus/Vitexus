### 🔧 Technical Changes
### Technical Changelog Summary
This period’s activity was focused exclusively on documentation and developer-activity visualizations. The repository’s README WakaTime graph was regenerated and committed multiple times by CI, and weekly changelog/documentation entries were updated manually. No application logic, tests, or refactorings were introduced.

#### Main Changes by Category

**Features:**
- No new application features were added.

**Bug Fixes:**
- No bug fixes were included.

**Refactoring:**
- No code refactoring occurred.

**Infrastructure/DevOps:**
- GitHub Actions automation ran repeatedly to regenerate the WakaTime README graph and committed the generated assets back to the repository (commits by github-actions[bot] on 2025-11-18, 2025-11-19, 2025-11-21, 2025-11-22, 2025-11-23, and 2025-11-24).
- The CI workflow is configured to produce and commit README telemetry artifacts; this is a low-risk documentation update pattern but requires a CI identity with repository write permissions.

**Documentation:**
- README visualization updated: the WakaTime-based graph in the repository README was refreshed to include newly tracked metrics across the above CI runs.
- Weekly changelog/documentation updated: docs/changelog (week 47, 2025) and a manual weekly update were committed by Vitexus (2025-11-17) and Vítězslav Dvořák (2025-11-21), respectively, to capture recent activity and reference the refreshed metrics.

**Testing:**
- No tests were added or modified.

#### Technical Highlights
- Automation-first: Continued use of GitHub Actions to regenerate and commit WakaTime/metrics graphs keeps README visuals current without manual intervention.
- Scope and impact: All changes are documentation/artifact updates (images/markdown); there are no changes to application logic, dependencies, or runtime behavior.
- Security/permissions: The workflow requires a CI token with repository write access. Ensure tokens are scoped minimally and rotated periodically.
- Operational note: Frequent automated commits can clutter history. Consider batching updates, reducing run frequency, or using distinct commit messages/tags to improve history clarity.

### 📈 User Impact
### Summary of Recent Updates
We refreshed the repository’s public activity visuals (README/project overview) to show additional, more relevant and up‑to‑date metrics and published the Week 47 changelog as part of our routine weekly content update.
